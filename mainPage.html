                In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a filler text or greeking commonly used to demonstrate the textual elements                 of a graphic document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content with placeholder text allows designers to design                  the form of the content before the content itself has been produced.The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of                 De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it                      nonsensical, improper Latin.
